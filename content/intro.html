					<p>The Center for NextGen Learning &amp; Assessment conducts research on new methods and technologies to support students, teachers, and educational decision makers with more realistic, engaging learning and assessment experiences. Current core topics are to increase capabilities, quality, and efficacy in the areas of performance assessment and automated scoring.</p>

				<p>The Center for NextGen Learning &amp; Assessment has developed a Framework of Approaches to Performance Assessments to answer that question. This framework provides a detailed description of seven approaches to performance assessment. It also includes innovative examples from a variety of sources to create a foundational understanding among policy makers, educators, parents, and even students about these assessments.</p>
				<p>All students should have access to engaging learning that helps them apply complex 21st century skills and prepare for brighter futures. Performance assessment that is linked to rigorous curriculum and instruction helps drive more comprehensive learning and measure achievement as required by the Common Core State Standards (CCSS).</p>
