				<h2>Context for Use</h2>
				<div class="imageContent"></div>
				<p class="spaceBelow">Typically, performance assessments emulate a context outside of the assessment in which the KSAs ultimately will be applied; require use of complex knowledge, skills, and/or reasoning; and require application of evaluation criteria to determine levels of quality, correctness, or completeness.</p>
				<h2>Purposes</h2>
				<p>Performance assessments support both formative and summative uses and are believed to be useful for guiding instruction and encouraging educators to increase expectations for student learning. Proponents argue that performance assessments constitute more direct evidence of what students know and can do than more constrained assessment approaches.</p>
