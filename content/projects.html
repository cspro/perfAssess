					<dt><a href="">Definitions</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Projects are long-term, extended performances that are organized around a driving question or problem and often result in a culminating product or presentation. Projects engage learners (alone or with others) in complex, multistep processes that require a diverse array of knowledge and skills: subject-matter knowledge (possibly from multiple disciplines), discrete skills, and higher-order competencies, such as problem solving, creativity, communication, collaboration, and metacognition. </p>
						<p>Projects are typically framed within engaging, meaningful, and realistic contexts and provide opportunities for self-directed student learning and autonomy in producing the product or preparing the presentation. Projects represent an almost equal blending of instruction, learning, and assessment.</p>
					</dd>

							<li>Believed to increase student interest, engagement, and motivation </li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="">Common Contexts</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Projects are commonly used in K-12 classroom contexts (e.g., term papers and science fair projects) and postsecondary assessments (e.g., honors theses and group research presentations).</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="">Design Variations and Other Considerations</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>All projects involve some degree of student self-directed learning, although the level of student autonomy supported within a given project can vary. For example, teachers may involve students in identifying the problem or driving question. Alternatively, the teacher may select the driving question, but allow students to choose their own methods for investigation or identify specific sub-topics to pursue. </p>
						<p>Similarly, the teacher&rsquo;s role during a project is to act as a facilitator, rather than as a leader or expert; however, the particular level of scaffolding, support, or direction a teacher provides may vary, depending on characteristics of the students or the nature of the project itself. The level of open-endedness of the problem or driving question can also vary, ranging from a problem with multiple possible solutions or multiple paths to a given solution to an indeterminate problem, or a problem with no known solution.</p>
						<p>Projects may or may not involve collaboration with peers or consultation with others, such as teachers, parents, or experts. Examples of projects involving collaboration with others include group research projects, science fair projects, and presentations. There are also examples of projects that are completed primarily on an individual basis, such as a Master&rsquo;s thesis or high school social studies research paper. Projects may integrate content and themes across multiple subjects, domains, or disciplines, or they may be focused within a single area of study.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="">Response Demands</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>In a project, examinees are asked to perform some combination of the following: articulate a problem, identify hypotheses, gather information, plan, self-monitor progress, work with others (communicate effectively, share responsibility), design and implement investigations, summarize results, and report findings via multiple communication modes, including written, graphical/visual, and oral.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="">Evaluation Criteria and Procedures</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Projects offer opportunities for both formative and summative evaluation of student learning. Formative evaluation might focus on observations of student interactions with teammates or on interim artifacts, such as outlines, research plans, or reference lists that are produced over the duration of the project and form the basis for progress monitoring and feedback to students. Summative evaluation might focus on a culminating work product, such as a written report or presentation that is used to assign student grades.</p>
						<p>Projects may be used to assess a wide range of student learning outcomes, ranging from traditional command of subject-matter knowledge to mastery of discrete skills and procedures, to more complex, so-called &ldquo;21st century&rdquo; skills: communication, collaboration, critical thinking and problem-solving, creativity, and self-directed learning or metacognition.</p>
						<p>When projects are completed by groups rather than individuals, there are particular challenges associated with evaluation and scoring. For example, educators are typically interested in obtaining individual student grades, but group projects tend to obscure individual contributions (Webb, 1995). Often teachers will assign a single grade to a group based on completion of the group project, and this group score in turn is assigned to each individual group member. However, to the extent that individual student contributions are not comparable or equivalent, this does not necessarily reflect individual effort, knowledge, or skills (Race, 2001; Saner et al., 1994; Webb, 1995). </p>
						<p>Research shows that group-level assessments may not yield scores that are predictive of individual-level ability, even when individual students turn in separate work products. In particular, scores from group work tend to over-estimate individual performance, and exhibit both ceiling effects and range restriction (Webb, 1993). If this higher performance reflects real learning, then group project scores are not necessarily invalid. However, if students obtain higher scores from group projects simply because their more able group mates complete most of the work, then using group scores as indicators of individual student learning is problematic.</p>
