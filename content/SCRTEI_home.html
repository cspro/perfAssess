					<h2>Short Constructed-Response</h2>

					<p> Short constructed-response (SCR) items, whether paper-based or online-administered, require examinees to develop a partial or full response to a stimulus or prompt as opposed to selecting from a limited set of pre-specified options. </p>
					In general, features of SCR items include:
					<ul>
						<li> Elicit textual or graphical responses that are discrete and brief </li>
						<li> Often allow multiple appropriate answers and/or partial credit scoring </li>
						<li> May better support diagnosis and remediation of certain specific skill deficiencies than selected-response items </li>
						<li> May be human or machine scorable </li>
					</ul>
					<p> Technology-enhanced items (TEIs) feature technology enhancements— such as the addition of interactive functionality, sound, graphics, animation, or video—intended to substantially improve some aspect of measurement. </p>

					In general, features of TEIs include:
					<ul>
						<li> Elicit responses that are discrete and brief </li>
						<li> Are typically machine scorable </li>
						<li> Expand the range of content, knowledge, or skills that are assessable in large-scale contexts compared to traditional paper-and-pencil formats </li>
					</ul>
