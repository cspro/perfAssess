						<h1>What Are Performance Tasks?</h1>

					<dt><a href="">Definitions</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Performance tasks require examinees to process and use one or more stimulus materials in responding to a series of discrete items or activities that are organized coherently around a common theme or culminating activity. Collectively, these activities reflect multiple content standards, skills, and/or processes that represent valued learning outcomes. Performance tasks are typically embedded in contexts that simulate realistic instructional, professional, or on-the-job activities, where the simulation is characterized by at least a moderate degree of fidelity between the assessment activities and the criterion performance(s) to which we would like to generalize. One or more component items within a performance task are typically evaluated using a rubric.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="">Characteristic Features</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<ul>
							<li>Collection of discrete items or activities organized around a theme or culminating activity</li>
							<li>Makes use of one or more stimulus materials</li>
							<li>Set in contexts that simulate realistic instructional, professional, or on-the-job activities</li>
							<li>At least a moderate degree of fidelity between the assessment activity and the criterion performance</li>
							<li>Focus on valued learning outcomes</li>
							<li>Align to multiple content standards, skills, or processes</li>
							<li>Evaluation procedures typically involve the application of one or more rubrics</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="">Common Contexts</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Performance tasks are commonly used in classroom formative contexts (e.g., a biology lab exercise), summative K-12 settings (e.g., a district/state assessment or an Advanced Placement exam), and certification or licensure examinations.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="">Design Variations and Other Considerations</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p><strong>Item and Scoring Options</strong><strong> </strong>
							<br>
							The discrete items or activities that comprise a task may combine several formats, including selected-response, technology-enhanced, or constructed-response (short or extended). These items or activities may or may not culminate in an extended performance that occurs at the end of the task and ties together preceding activities.</p>
						<p>Depending on the types of items or activities included in a task, items may be machine-scored, human-scored, or some combination. Machine scorable items may include those scored with an automated scoring engine.</p>
						<p><strong>Purposes</strong><strong> </strong></p>
						<p>Performance tasks can be used for summative purposes (e.g., holding teachers or students accountable for learning) or for classroom formative purposes. Performance tasks designed to fulfill one of these goals will not necessarily collect information useful for serving the other. For example, tasks used for high-stakes summative purposes require a higher level of standardization of task administration conditions (e.g., testing time, student instructions, prompts, available resources and supports) than tasks used for classroom formative purposes. In the latter context, tasks may be modified to fit student interest or ability by allowing students to choose the manner in which they will respond or by allowing students to submit portions of the task over an extended period of time.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="">Response Demands</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>In a performance task, examinees are asked to respond to the discrete items or activities that comprise the task. Depending on the purpose of the task, students may respond orally, in writing, via a concrete work product (e.g., a graph or drawing), or some combination of the three. For performance tasks that include technology-enhanced items, students respond using technology capabilities, such as clicking, dragging, or otherwise manipulating the online interface.</p>
						What distinguishes performance tasks from other approaches of performance assessments is the wide range of potential response demands and modes that can be represented within a single task.
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="">Evaluation Criteria and Procedures</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Performance tasks (or pieces of them) commonly require application of one or more rubrics. Typically, there are separate rubrics created for each discrete item or activity within a task, but one might also create a rubric for the overall task performance. Rubrics may be holistic or analytic. They may focus on a single dimension of performance or encompass multiple dimensions of performance, depending on the purpose of the assessment. For example, performance tasks that feature a culminating written performance might focus on both the content of the essay (e.g., student knowledge of a specific history topic), as well as the quality of the writing (e.g., organization, voice, use of writing conventions).</p>

					<dt><a href="">Administration Time</a></dt>
					<dd>
						May range from 45 minutes to several hours or even over several days or weeks
