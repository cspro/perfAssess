					<dt><a href="">Definitions</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A portfolio assessment can be defined as a purposeful collection of an examinee&rsquo;s work that is intended to illustrate (a) current proficiency; performance; or knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), or (b) growth over time in proficiency; performance; or KSAs.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="">Characteristic Features</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<ul>
							<li>May be printed or electronic copies of text and graphical material that the candidate has produced; other pieces of work; or video and audio recordings of candidate performances, products, and reflections.</li>
							<li>Includes a broad sampling, as well as a range of types of evidence, of the examinee&rsquo;s proficiency, performance, and KSAs, whether current status or growth.</li>
							<li>Criteria and procedures for evaluating the pieces of work are specified for the examinee. </li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="">Common Contexts</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Portfolios are commonly used in educational assessment contexts, including formative and summative, particularly as alternate assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities. They can also be used in career-related contexts to showcase work products or performances, such as collections of photographs, videos, or other artifacts to demonstrate evidence of proficiency towards a particular job function or skill.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="">Design Variations and Other Considerations</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>For some portfolios, the examinee selects and assembles the pieces of evidence (e.g., portfolios of artists and architects). For other portfolios, someone else may select and assemble the pieces of evidence (e.g., a teacher who assembles an alternate assessment portfolio for students with significant cognitive disabilities).</p>
						<p>For some assessment portfolios, inclusion criteria are highly specified (e.g., for alternate assessment portfolios). For other assessment portfolios, inclusion criteria may be minimal (e.g., portfolios assembled by artists, architects).</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="">Response Demands</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The examinee (or someone representing the examinee) must select pieces of evidence to include in an&nbsp;assessment portfolio, based on the selection and inclusion specifications. The pieces of evidence are intended to support inferences about current status or growth of proficiency, performance, and KSAs&nbsp;. Examinees may be required to document reflections on the pieces of evidence that provide rationales for inclusion of pieces; explain the thinking and processes behind creating the pieces of evidence; or explain how the pieces of evidence demonstrate either current status or growth of proficiency, performance, and KSAs.</p>
						<p>Pieces of evidence that are eligible for inclusion in a portfolio may include written work and other products; audio or video recordings of the examinee that capture a performance, product, demonstration, or reflections; and documentation of external evaluation of the examinee&rsquo;s performance, product, or demonstration.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="">Evaluation Criteria and Procedures</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Written and other concrete forms of evidence are typically scored using one or more rubrics.&nbsp;Performances (whether live or recorded) may be scored using a rubric or evaluated using an observation checklist that identifies specific behaviors or indicators related to the evaluation criteria. Rubrics can be holistic or analytic and evaluation may focus on a narrow set of traits or a more diverse collection of attributes. During evaluation, judges or raters may be able to attach annotations or comment codes to various pieces of evidence as a form of feedback to examinees.</p>
						<p>Depending on whether the purpose of the portfolio is to assess an examinee&rsquo;s current status or growth over time, evaluation criteria may include specific qualities of performances or products (e.g., completeness, consistency) or may instead focus on whether the pieces of evidence demonstrate improvement over time in those qualities. It is especially common when the purpose of the portfolio is to assess growth for the examinee&nbsp;to provide reflection on each piece of evidence that explains how they demonstrate growth or improvement over time.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="">Administration Time</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The time required to complete a portfolio varies, depending on the purpose of the portfolio, the range of skills assessed, the number and types of pieces of evidence that are selected, and whether reflection is required. When the purpose of the portfolio is to document growth over time or when the portfolio targets a broad and diverse range of skills, pieces of evidence may be collected over a large span of time (e.g., several months, a year). Conversely, when the purpose of the portfolio is to assess current status or maximal performance or when the portfolio is focused on a relatively narrow range of knowledge and skills, pieces of evidence may be collected within a shorter period of time (e.g, several weeks, a few months).</p>
